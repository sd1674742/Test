## **Month 1: Data Collection and Preparation**
### Goals:
- Identify and gather relevant datasets.
- Establish data pipelines for real-time updates.

### Tasks:
1. **Research and Data Gathering**:
   - Collect historical data on plastic production, demand, and supply chain disruptions.
   - Sources: industry reports, government statistics, news on supply chain events, and IoT sensors.
2. **Integrate Real-Time Feeds**:
   - API integration with sources like shipping schedules, raw material pricing, and weather data.
   - Platforms: Bloomberg, maritime tracking services, and commodity indices.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and anomalies.
   - Standardize units and formats (e.g., weight, pricing in USD).
4. **Data Storage Setup**:
   - Implement cloud-based storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
   - Structure datasets using SQL/NoSQL for easy querying.

## **Month 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering**
### Goals:
- Understand key factors influencing the supply chain.
- Prepare data for model training.

### Tasks:
1. **EDA**:
   - Visualize trends in pricing, delays, and disruptions.
   - Identify correlations between variables (e.g., oil prices and plastic resin costs).
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create predictive features:
     - Lead times, shipping bottlenecks, inventory levels.
     - Weather impacts on transportation.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., supplier location, resin types).
3. **Baseline Metrics**:
   - Define performance KPIs: RMSE, prediction accuracy, and event detection precision.

## **Month 3: Model Selection and Initial Training**
### Goals:
- Develop and validate baseline models.
- Fine-tune features and hyperparameters.

   - Choose initial algorithms:
     - Time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet) for demand forecasting.
     - Machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest) for disruption prediction.
     - Neural networks (LSTM) for sequential and temporal data.
2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split datasets into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Apply time-series cross-validation techniques.
3. **Initial Training**:
   - Train baseline models with default hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate performance and log results.
4. **Model Comparison**:
   - Compare performance across different models.
   - Select top-performing models for further tuning.

## **Month 4: Advanced Training and Optimization**
### Goals:
- Enhance model accuracy and robustness.
- Prepare for deployment.

### Tasks:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use grid search or Bayesian optimization.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for top models.
2. **Incorporate External Factors**:
   - Add macroeconomic indicators (e.g., oil prices, trade tariffs).
   - Test models with real-time event data streams.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Validate models on unseen data.
   - Measure prediction accuracy and robustness under simulated disruptions.
4. **Model Ensembling**:
   - Combine models (e.g., blending LSTM with Random Forest) for improved accuracy.

## **Month 5: Deployment and Monitoring**
### Goals:
- Deploy the system.
- Set up continuous learning and monitoring.

### Tasks:
1. **Model Deployment**:
   - Use a scalable platform (e.g., AWS SageMaker, TensorFlow Serving).
   - Set up APIs for real-time predictions and observations.
2. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Build visualization tools for predictions and insights (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
   - Include key metrics like lead times, price forecasts, and disruption alerts.
3. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Implement logging for model performance and errors.
   - Develop feedback loops to retrain the model with updated data.
4. **User Testing**:
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to validate system usability.
   - Gather feedback for improvements.
